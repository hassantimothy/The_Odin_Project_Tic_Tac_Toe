# The_Odin_Project_Tic_Tac_Toe
Project Description
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The objective is to create a user-friendly and engaging interface for players to enjoy this timeless game. The project is divided into several components to ensure code organization and functionality.

Features
Gameboard Object: The gameboard is represented as an array within a Gameboard object. This object is responsible for keeping track of the game state.

Player Objects: Players are stored as objects, allowing for customizable player names.

Modular Code: The project emphasizes modular code, ensuring that components are organized into logical structures. Modules are used for single instances (e.g., gameboard), while factories create multiple instances (e.g., players).

Interactive UI: The game includes an interactive user interface where players can click on the game board to place their marks. It prevents players from choosing already occupied spots.

Game Flow Control: An object manages the flow of the game, switching between players and checking for win or tie conditions.

End Game Conditions: The game logic checks for 3-in-a-row and ties. It displays a message to congratulate the winning player.

Optional AI Opponent: For those seeking a challenge, there's an optional AI opponent. Initially, the AI makes random legal moves, but it can be further improved using the minimax algorithm for an unbeatable AI.

Player Customization: Players can input their names in the interface to personalize their gaming experience.

Game Controls: Start or restart the game using the provided button for convenience.

Inspiration
The project structure and organization draw inspiration from the "Building a House from the Inside Out" article, focusing on effective code organization for a more manageable development process.
